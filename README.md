#Sales Dashboard
This project demonstrates how interactive dashboards can be used to analyze business performance and uncover insights from raw data.
I used Power BI to clean, transform, and visualize the dataset, showcasing key business metrics such as:

Revenue trends over time

Regional performance comparison

Customer segmentation

Product-wise profitability

The goal of this project is to show how data-driven decisions can be supported with effective visualizations.
✅ Data cleaning & transformation using Power Query
✅ DAX measures for KPIs (e.g., Revenue Growth %, Profit Margin)
✅ Dynamic filtering with slicers (Region, Time, Product)
✅ Drill-through analysis for detailed insights
✅ Interactive dashboard design
